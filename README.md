Advanced Cloud Image Builder

This tool is based on Matt Palmer's UCIB tool. Additional functionaility has been added as well as more advanced support for more cloud platforms and distros. It's rather specific  at the moment and needs to be generified. 

Currently, this repo only exists publicly for presentation purposes.
